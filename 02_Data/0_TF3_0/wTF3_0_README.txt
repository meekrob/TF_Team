# wTF3.0 Database

Robert Williams

This dataset was originated from the following paper:
Fuxman Bass JI, Pons C, Kozlowski L, et al. A gene‐centered C. elegans protein–DNA interaction network provides a framework for functional predictions. Molecular Systems Biology. 2016;12(10):884. doi:10.15252/msb.20167131.

And was downloaded from the following website:

Which is now saved as "inline-supplementary-material-4.xlsx"

With the following description of how the set was generated:
"C. elegans TFs list wTF3.0

We updated our previously published list of C. elegans TFs (Reece‐Hoyes et al, 2011b). First, we removed nine pseudogenes and four genes whose status changed to dead gene according to WormBase version WS252 (Dataset EV3). Second, we removed 18 genes that have been characterized as having non‐TF functions such as dcp‐66, ubxn‐1, and irld‐33, which are cofactors, membrane proteins (e.g., frpr‐9 and srab‐2), and a protease (atg‐4.1). The remaining set of TFs was supplemented with 21 unconventional DNA‐binding proteins (i.e., proteins that can bind DNA but that lack a recognizable DNA‐binding domain (Deplancke et al, 2006), hereafter grouped together with the TFs) for which we detected PDIs in this study, three genes that have been re‐annotated in WormBase, six proteins classified as TFs by other groups that bind DNA in vitro in PBM assays (Narasimhan et al, 2015) or SELEX (Mathelier et al, 2014), and five proteins newly classified as TFs in WormBase based on having a known DNA‐binding domain (maf‐1, zip‐9, madf‐6, nhr‐236, and T10B5.10). This updated compendium of TF predictions contains 941 TFs and is referred to as wTF3.0 (Dataset EV3)."

I was given a processed version of this file by erin, which is called "TF3-0_namesony.txt"
